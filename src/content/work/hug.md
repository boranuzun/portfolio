During my internship at Hôpitaux Universitaires de Genève, I was responsible for providing Level 1 IT support to hospital staff. My key responsibilities included:

- Providing technical assistance and support for incoming queries and issues related to the Learning Management System (LMS) and other internal applications.
- Resolving user issues efficiently to ensure minimal disruption to employees' work.
- Creating and updating documentation to help users navigate common issues independently.
- Diagnosing Learning Center's hardware problems and recommending solutions.

This role allowed me to develop strong problem-solving skills and gain valuable experience in IT support within a healthcare environment.
