This is my personal portfolio and blog website built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). It uses the [Astro Nano theme](https://astro.build/themes/details/astronano/) from [Mark Horn](https://markhorn.dev/) as a starting point, and I've customized it to showcase my projects and blog posts.
