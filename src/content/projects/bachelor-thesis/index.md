My Bachelor’s thesis, titled "Conception et déploiement automatisé d’un Operating System as Code à l’aide de pratiques Infrastructure as Code," focuses on the design and automated deployment of an Operating System as Code using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices. This project explores the methodologies and tools necessary to implement an OS as Code framework, emphasizing automation, scalability, and maintainability.
